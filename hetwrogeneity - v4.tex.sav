\section*{Introduction}


%[Phenotyping]
Using sunlight, water and $CO_2$, plants produce sugars and release $O_2$ with photosynthesis \cite{kramer2011importance}. The process involves the formation of high energy intermediates capable of generating reactive oxygen species. The photosynthetic apparatus, chloroplast and surrounding leaf tissue is inherently susceptible to oxidative damage, especially under stress conditions when the supply of light energy exceeds the capacity to utilize it \cite{asada1996radical,durrant1990characterisation}. Plants have evolved a number of mechanisms, such as photosynthetic apparatus damage and repair \cite{melis1999photosystem}, to dissipate excess light energy to minimize the potential for damage at the expense of photosynthetic efficiency \cite{adams2006energy,rochaix2014regulation}. However, these mechanisms are sensitive to leaf development and thus may change from one leave tissue to another, resulting in heterogenous photosynthetic patterns (see Figure \ref{fig:heterogeneityexample}). These patterns also vary with the position, size and growth rate of leaves, since leaves at the same node is unique in age. By integrating plant morphological and physiological features, measuring plant photosynthetic heterogeneity aids interpretation of the sophisticated photosynthesis phonemics data, particularly important for plant primary productivity estimation and modeling \cite{meng2007spatial}.

%Advanced technologies in high-throughput plant photosynthetic phenotyping (the Dynamic Environment Photosynthesis Imager, or DEPI) have been developed \cite{cruz2014depi,houle2010phenomics}. These systems generate huge amount of images of plant photosynthesis that can be used to quantify photosynthetic behavior in genetically diverse populations, leading to better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the photosynthetic properties \cite{fiorani2013future,rascher2011non}, enabling to measure variability in various photosynthetic parameters at high resolution across leaves.

%The model of spatial heterogeneity of the photosynthetic properties may reveal $CO_2$ intake capability, stomatal conductance and tolerance level to environmental changes of leaf tissues at different developmental stages.

%photosynthetic heterogeneity refers to a plant comprising multiple regions, a significant amount of which have different photosynthesis properties, %. %For example, under full sunlight photosynthesis usually captures at most only of available energy (bonner1962upper, von1981some, kramer2011importance).

Heterogeneity is a concept relating to the uniformity in a substance. The granularity of photosynthetic heterogeneity ranges from cells to tissues, leaves, and even the whole plant. While in-leaf variability in photosynthetic activity has been well-studied for the understanding of the effects of stomatal conductance \cite{Buckley1997,Cheeseman1991}, recent works show that photosynthetic capacity may decline with vertical gradient and leaf age \cite{chen2008effect,Kitajima2002}, suggesting that leaf-based photosynthetic heterogeneity is a key towards the understanding of plant photosynthesis.

The leaf heterogeneity in photosynthesis was firstly been studied  with a simulation model \cite{chen2008effect}. Due to the lack of high-throughput phenotyping technologies, the authors determined the effects of biochemical variability via the Farquhar model incorporating defined degrees of spatial variability of its parameters. The Farquhar model is a mechanistic, biochemical model widely used to describe steady-state $CO_2$ assimilation in leaves \cite{farquhar2001models,sharkey1985o2}. Spatial heterogeneity in photosynthesis was found to have an effect on the ability of the Farquhar model to accurately characterize photosynthesis at the leaf level \cite{chen2008effect}.

Recently, with the advent of advanced technologies of biomedical imaging, directly measuring heterogeneity has recently assumed new importance {\cite{cruz2014depi,tiihonen1996cerebral,wieneke1999non,wang2000}. The rapid development of lighting and imaging techniques enables real-time non-invasive monitoring of photosynthesis \cite{cruz2014depi,houle2010phenomics}, resulting in vast amount of chlorophyll fluorescence images of plants \cite{wituszynska2013multivariable}. These images can be used to quantify photosynthetic behavior in genetically diverse populations, enabling to measure variability of photosynthetic parameters at high resolution across leaves, leading to better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the photosynthetic properties \cite{fiorani2013future,rascher2011non}.

In order to measure leaf-based photosynthetic variability in a large-scale phenotyping experiment, in which hundreds of plants are screened simultaneously, it is required to automatically segment each leaf from whole plant images, and then measure the variations of photosynthesis parameters across leaves.
%
Plant chlorophyll fluorescence images are false-color images, where the light intensity of every pixel is proportional to photosynthetic efficiency \cite{toet1996new} (see Figure \ref{fig:heterogeneityexample}). Differences between individual leaves with similar photosynthetic efficiency can be subtle, making the boundaries between them difficult to define and creating a significant challenge for subsequent shape analysis. The difficulty even arises when individual leaves overlap and occlude one another in these false-color images.
%challenges in heterogeneity measure
On the other hand, due to the nature of plant, leaf-based photosynthetic heterogeneity often includes a small number of leaves (for example the rosette leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana), and thus the power of the traditional Cochran's Q-test in such circumstances is low \cite{higgins2003measuring, gavaghan2000evaluation,huedo2006assessing}. Furthermore, plants have different numbers of leaves, varying sizes, and different growth rates \cite{van1991insertional}, but none of them  has yet  been taken into the computation of  heterogeneity.

%We have developed a new leaf segmentation approach called PlantPH to identify leaves from photosynthesis images...

In this paper, we present a new computational framework called {\it Plant Photosynthesis Heterogeneity} (PlantPH) and use the tool to measure the leaf-level photosynthesis heterogeneity patterns of more than 100 Arabidopsis chloroplast mutant strains over dynamic lighting conditions, each with at least four replicates. It is followed with an outlier detection process to identify mutants with distinct heterogeneity patterns under specific subsets of the environmental conditions.

\section*{Results}

Plant photosynthetic heterogeneity refers to a plant comprising multiple regions, many of which have different photosynthesis properties, potentially because of vastly different leaf developmental stage and tolerance level to environmental changes. By developing an efficient plant photosynthetic heterogeneity measure PlantPH and applying it on more than 100 Arabidopsis chloroplast mutant strains, we show that ...

\subsection*{Framework of PlantPH} \label{sec:PlantPH}

We first introduce the framework of PlantPH which consists three major modules: leaf alignment, leaf-based heterogeneity measurement, and heterogeneity outlier detection. The architecture of the application is shown in Figure ??.

%First of all, we have developed the leaf alignment algorithm \cite{yin2014}. This paper focus on the measure of

Comparing with the existing heterogeneity approaches, our method is novel in the following ways:

1.	PlantPH relies on a novel leaf alignment and tracking method... %, which considers plant-specific constraints including leaf shape similarity and symmetry. By taking the biological knowledge about the shapes of any possible leaf into account, we add flexibility to the model to fit to all the general leaves. Specifically, for leaf boundary identification, we develop a leaf symmetry based curve fitting model to define the initial shape of a leaf, and develop a plant layout based approach to define leaf tips and orientation, therefore defining the leaf initial position.  Note that since leaf is assumed to be symmetric, curve fitting could converge without large amount of training.

2. PlantPH models heterogeneity of photosynthesis with size, position and growth rate...

3. PlantPH refers to the differences between individual leaf photosynthesis and the pooled photosynthesis across all the leaves, with the weights being those used in the pooling method. With PlantPH, transient regional variation events that do not affect the whole plant photosynthesis, can be easily discovered.

\subsubsection*{General leaf-based heterogeneity measure}

The usual way of assessing whether the leaves of a plant are photosynthetically homogeneous or heterogeneous  is by means of the Cochran's Q-test \cite{conover1999Practical} and the $I^2$ statistic \cite{higgins2003measuring,higgins2002quantifying}.
%
First of all, the effect estimate $T_{i}$ of leaf $l_i$ in plant $p$ is defined as the difference between the averaged photosynthetic values of the leaf $\mu(l_i)$ and  the whole plant $\mu(p)$.
%
And then, the Cochran's Q-test is computed by summing the squared deviations of each leaf's effect estimate from overall effect estimate, weighting the contribution of each leaf's effect estimate by its inverse variance \cite{conover1999Practical}.
%
In addition, the $I^2$ statistic measures the extent of true heterogeneity dividing the difference between the Cochran's Q-test value and its degree of freedom by the Q-test value \cite{higgins2003measuring,higgins2002quantifying}.


Mathematically, let $T = \{T_{1}, T_{1}, \ldots, T_{n}\}$ be the set of effect estimates of a plant $p$ with $n$ leaves. In each effect estimate $T_i$, let $u_i$ and $u_p$ be the averaged photosynthesis values of leaf $l_i$ and the whole plant $p$, respectively. Under the assumption of normal distribution and homoscedasticity, the effect estimate $T_i$ is the standardized mean difference \cite{hedges1998fixed}, which can be estimated by: %$T_{i} = c(l_i) (mean(l_i)-mean(p))/S(l_i,p)$ ,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:effectestimate}
T_{i} =  \frac{c(l_i)\left(\mu(l_i)-\mu(p)\right)}{S(l_i,p)}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $c(l_i)$ is a correction factor for the positive bias suffered by the standardized mean difference with small sample sizes, which can be estimated by $c(l_i) = 1-3/(4(|l_i|-1)-1)$ \cite{hedge1985statistical}. This adjustment will reduce the effect estimate of small leaves that only have a few pixels, and thus increase the robustness of the heterogeneity model \cite{huedo2006assessing}.
%
%According to the equation of $c(L_i, L_j)$, $c(L_i, L_j)$ is close to 1 for large leaves with many pixels, otherwise it is close to 0, down-weighing the value of heterogeneity.
%
The pooled estimate of the within-group standard deviation $S(l_i, p)$ can be computed with \cite{hedges1998fixed}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:S}
S(l_i, p) = \sqrt{\frac{(|l_i|-1)std^2(l_i)+(|p|-1)std^2(p)}{|l_i|+|p|-2}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $std^2(l_i)$ and $std^2(p)$ are the population standard deviations of leaf $l_i$ and the whole plant $p$, and $|l_i|$ and $|p|$ are the total number of pixels of leaf $l_i$ and the whole plant $p$, respectively.

%The sample variance of $T_{ij}$ is estimated using Equation \ref{eq:ST} \cite{hedges1998fixed}.
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:ST}
%ST_{ij} = \frac{|L_i|+|L_j|}{|L_i||L_j|}+\frac{T_{ij}^2}{2(|L_i|+|L_j|)}
%\end{equation}

Then we apply the Cochran's Q-test statistic for determining whether there is true leaf-based photosynthetic heterogeneity among the leaves:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Q}
%Q=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\left(T_i-mean(T)\right)^2}{\tau^2}
Q=\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\left(T_i-\frac{\sum_{j=1}^n w_jT_j}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_j}\right)^2
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n$ is the total number of leaves of the plant $p$,  the right part of the equation is the weighted mean of effect estimates of all the leaves of the plant $p$, and $w_i=1/(\tau^2+\delta_i^2)$, where $\delta_i^2$ is the sampling variance of the effect estimate $T_i$, and $\tau^2$ is the between-study variance of all the effect estimates \cite{huedo2006assessing}.

To estimate the sampling variance $\delta_i^2$ of the effect estimate of leaf $l_i$, we use the photosynthetic values of all the pixels of the high-resolution florescence images. Since the total number of samples of a leaf (number of pixels) is at least 100, $\delta_i^2$ is close to 0 \cite{huedo2006assessing}. Therefore, we ignore the computation of  $\delta_i^2$ and replace it with 0.

The averaged leaf cell size of Arabidopsis is about $6000 \mu m^2$ \cite{gegas2014endopolyploidy}. 

The between-study variance $\tau^2$ is the parameter in the statistical model that mainly represents the true heterogeneity among the true effects of the studies. Therefore, a good procedure for determining whether there is true heterogeneity among all leaves of a plant should be positively correlated with $\tau^2$. Meanwhile, it be independent to the total number of leaves, %and should be scale-free
in order to be comparable among different plants.
%
We estimate $\tau^2$ using the method of moments \cite{dersimonian1986meta}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau}
\tau^2 = \left\{\begin{matrix}
 \frac{\widetilde{Q}-(n-1)}{\sum \widetilde{w_{i}}-\sum \widetilde{w_{i}}^2/\sum \widetilde{w_{i}}} & \widetilde{Q}>|T|+1\\
 0 & else
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\widetilde{Q}$ and $\widetilde{w_{i}}$ are the results of Q test of fixed effect estimate and the corresponding weight, which is computed as:	

\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight}
\widetilde{w_{i}} = \frac{1}{std^2(l_i)+c }
\end{equation}

%[Pos(L_i)\neq  Pos(L_j)] \times

One problem with the Q test is that its statistical power depends

\subsection*{Data Acquisition and Preprocessing}

In the photosynthesis phenotyping experiment, hundreds of Arabidopsis thaliana plants (wild type, genetic variations with gene knockout or over-expression, ecotypes, etc) were grown side-by-side under three different light conditions (constant, sinusoid, fluctuate), for in total three days.
%
Top-view fluorescence images were collected every 15 minutes in order to observe the photosynthesis activity of all of the plants simultaneously. Each fluorescence image is a grey-scale image with a resolution of 1M pixels at 12-bit intensity.

To accurately capture the photosynthesis activities of plants from fluorescence images, a image segment method is applied to remove the background, identify every piece of leaf~\cite{yin2014}, measure the intensity of pixels on leaves, and finally convert the intensity values to the measure of four kinds of photosynthesis parameters.
%
The extracted measurements of photosynthesis parameters are presented in the form of multi-dimensional time-series, one dimension for every photosynthesis parameter.
%
Figure 1 shows that the measurements of a photosynthesis parameter $\Phi_2$ at one time point are quite different for the leaves of the same plant  (i.e. plant no. 3-7 and 5-5).

\subsection*{Leaf alignment and tracking}

For completeness, we introduce the leaf alignment and tracking approach...

\subsection*{Heterogeneity Test}

Cochran's Q-test is the classical measure of heterogeneity \cite{conover1999Practical}. In leaf-based photosynthetic heterogeneity, Q is calculated as the weighted sum of squared differences between the photosynthesis value of a individual leaf and the pooled photosynthesis value across all leaves with the weights being those used in the pooling method. The distribution of Q is a chi-square statistic with $k-1$ degrees of freedom, where $k$ is the number of leaves. Cochran's Q-test has been widely used in biomedical studies. For example, heterogeneity in the aggressiveness of tumor cell populations has been adopted as an essential feature in predicting treatment success \cite{OSullivan2003}. However, due to the nature of plant, leaf-based photosynthetic heterogeneity often includes a small number of leaves, and thus the power of the Q-test in such circumstances is low \cite{higgins2003measuring, gavaghan2000evaluation}.
%
%Conversely, Q has too much power as a test of heterogeneity if the number of leaves is large \cite{higgins2003measuring}.

%An additional test is provided with the odds ratio meta-analysis \cite{breslow1987statistical}. It is arguably not possible to examine the null hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect, by considering the only the summary data from the studies: The heterogeneity test results should be considered alongside a qualitative assessment of the combinability of studies in a systematic review.

The $I^2$ statistic describes the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance \cite{higgins2002quantifying,higgins2003measuring}. $I^2$ can be calculated  as $I^2 = (Q - df)/Q$, where Q is Cochran's Q-test heterogeneity statistic and $df$ is the degrees of freedom. A negative value  indicates no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity. $I^2$ is an intuitive and simple expression of the inconsistency. $I^2$ of leaf-based photosynthetic heterogeneity does not inherently depend upon the number of leaves, so that $I^2$ values of different plants become comparable. A confidence interval for $I^2$ is constructed using either the iterative non-central chi-squared distribution method \cite{hedges2001power} or the test-based method \cite{higgins2002quantifying}.

Based on Cochran's Q-test and the $I^2$ statistic, we develop a new approach that quantifies the effect of heterogeneity of photosynthesis across leaves of the same plant, and compare the degree of inconsistency among mutant strains in varying environmental conditions (see Section~\ref{sec:PlantPH}). The challenges of this work include the leaf alignment and the new heterogeneity measure that takes leaf position, size and growth into consideration.

%To measure leaf-based photosynthetic variability in a large-scale phenotyping experiment, in which hundreds of plants are monitored in real time, it is naturally required to identify each leaf from top-view photosynthesis images automatically. However, leaf identification is a difficult task, in that 1) all the leaves are very similar in appearance especially for model plant Arabidopsis; 2) leaf features are much fewer than the well-studied face recognition problem; and 3) leaves may overlapped with each other that makes the problem more complicated. In short, there are two challenging computational problems. First, how to separate overlapped leaves in photosynthesis images where the leaf boundaries are obscure. Second, how to recognize incomplete leafs due to occlusion. Alternatively, approximation approaches can be used to estimate the leaf-based photosynthetic heterogeneity, including distribution based, region based and pixel based approaches. While these approximation approaches are easier to model, their performance may be reduced.

% Results and Discussion can be combined.


\section*{Discussion}

A consensus view of the data is that the photosynthesis ability of a plant is not uniform across the whole area (Charles 2008, Meng 2007).
%
The photosynthetic properties of plants can vary dramatically across cells, tissues, and organs~\cite{}, reflecting differences in development, stress responses, regulation of processes such as stomatal conductance~\cite{}, photodamage~\cite{}, and storage of photosynthate~\cite{} and contribute substantially to productivity~\cite{}.

For example, we observed that the acclimation of photosynthesis in response to cold temperatures appears to be more rapid and robust in younger or emerging than older leaves, and ecotypes isolated from different latitudes show distinct heterogeneity patterns, implying that these responses are important for adaptation of photosynthesis to fluctuating temperatures.
%
In other cases, exposure of plants to fluctuating light resulted in loss of photosynthetic capacity or increased photoinhibition in specific sets of leaves or leaf sectors. In many cases, older leaves are preferentially affected, suggesting that resources for maintenance or acclimation responses are preferentially directed to younger leaves. However, we have also identified mutant lines where younger leaves are preferentially affected, which presumably affect the development of photosynthetic robustness.

In order to systematically study the leaf level photosynthesis phenotypes, especially in a high-throughput screen manner, we developed a novel computational tool to automatically conduct statistical analysis on leaf based photosynthesis.
